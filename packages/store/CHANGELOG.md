### Minor Changes

- 8ac3dcc: Major performance update: Unified high-performance implementation

  **Store Package:**

  - Unified experimental implementation as the main and only solution
  - 2-4x faster performance with all hooks
  - O(1) message lookups with hash map indexing
  - Batched updates with priority scheduling
  - Deep equality checks prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Advanced throttling with scheduler.postTask
  - Memoized selectors with automatic caching
  - SSR compatible with Next.js App Router
  - Solves server messages re-render issues

  **Artifacts Package:**

  - Updated to work seamlessly with unified store
  - No more compatibility layers needed
  - Improved performance through optimized store integration

  **Devtools Package:**

  - Fixed SSR compatibility issues
  - Added proper "use client" directive
  - Works correctly with unified store implementation

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - Requires wrapping app with `<Provider>` component
