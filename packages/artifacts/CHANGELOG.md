## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 299a914: Release v0.4.0 with new useArtifacts hook and comprehensive improvements

  This stable release includes all the features from the beta versions:

  **New Features:**

  - Add new `useArtifacts` hook that listens to all artifacts across all types
  - Perfect for implementing switch cases to render different artifact types
  - Provides callback pattern with `onData` for real-time notifications
  - Returns `data` (grouped by type), `latestByType`, and `all` (chronological)

  **Improvements:**

  - Enhanced useArtifacts hook with better type safety and performance
  - Added comprehensive usage examples and documentation
  - Improved client exports and API consistency
  - Updated documentation with correct import patterns (`/client` for hooks)
  - Fixed API examples to use `artifact()` instead of deprecated `createArtifact()`
  - Updated website documentation to match package features

  **Developer Experience:**

  - Added comprehensive examples showing real-world usage patterns
  - Better type definitions and TypeScript support
  - Improved error handling and edge case coverage

- 8ac3dcc: Major performance update: Unified high-performance implementation

  **Store Package:**

  - Unified experimental implementation as the main and only solution
  - 2-4x faster performance with all hooks
  - O(1) message lookups with hash map indexing
  - Batched updates with priority scheduling
  - Deep equality checks prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Advanced throttling with scheduler.postTask
  - Memoized selectors with automatic caching
  - SSR compatible with Next.js App Router
  - Solves server messages re-render issues

  **Artifacts Package:**

  - Updated to work seamlessly with unified store
  - No more compatibility layers needed
  - Improved performance through optimized store integration

  **Devtools Package:**

  - Fixed SSR compatibility issues
  - Added proper "use client" directive
  - Works correctly with unified store implementation

  **Breaking Changes:**

  - Requires wrapping app with `<Provider>` component
  - No more `storeId` parameter needed (uses React Context)
  - Some legacy exports removed (migration guide available)

### Patch Changes
