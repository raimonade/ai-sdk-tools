                We believe that building AI applications should be as
                straightforward as building any other modern web application.
                These tools represent our distilled knowledge from creating
                production-ready AI interfaces that handle real user data and
                complex workflows.

                , the creator of AI SDK Tools. As a developer at Midday, I've
                spent countless hours building AI-powered financial interfaces
                that need to be both powerful and user-friendly. The challenges
                of managing complex AI state, debugging tool calls, and creating
                smooth streaming experiences led me to develop these tools.
              </p>
              <p className="text-xs font-light leading-relaxed">
                Each package in this toolkit represents a specific problem I
                encountered while building Midday's AI features. From managing
                chat state across multiple components to debugging complex tool
                call chains, these tools are battle-tested in production and
                ready for your next AI project.
